rem
rem -> I generate the resize statements only for datafiles which are autoextensible. 
rem    This is because I want to be sure that the datafiles can grow back to their original size if needed.
rem
rem -> When datafile is not autoextensible, or maxsize is not higher than the current size, I only generate a comment.
rem
rem -> When a datafile has no extents at all I generate a resize to 5MB. 
rem    I would like to find the minimum possible size (without getting ORA-3214) but my test do not validate yet what is documented in MOS. 
rem    If anyone has an idea, please share.
rem
rem -> There is probably a way to get that high water mark in a cheaper way. Because the alter statement gives the ORA-03297 much quicker. 
rem    Information is probably available in the datafile headers, without going to segment headers, but I donâ€™t know if it is exposed in a safe way. 
rem    If you have an idea, once again, please share.
